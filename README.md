# Simple Stock App

The motivation for the creation of this simple stock program is for an exercise in exploring Python features.

Using a subset of ftse data, the program provides various information for a stock on a given day.

The program allows you to create a portfolio, and generate information about that portfolio.

It also allows you to plot either a single stock's price over a given period or plot up to 6 stocks in a portfolio.

Finally, the program utilizes linear regression for its simple prediction component. 

Instead of using a library, the linear regression model is hard-coded on purpose.
